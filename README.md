# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters. The model is built using **Logistic Regression** and trained on a dataset containing multiple health attributes. The goal of this project is to provide an early diagnosis of heart disease based on user input, helping in early intervention and better prevention.

## Project Overview

The heart disease prediction system is built using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm, which classifies individuals as either having or not having heart disease based on several input features such as age, sex, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and more. The model is evaluated on test data, achieving an **accuracy of 81.97%**.

## Features

- **Logistic Regression model**: Used to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Data Analysis**: The dataset is thoroughly analyzed, and important features are selected to improve model accuracy.
- **Accurate Prediction**: Achieves an 81.97% accuracy on the test dataset.
- **Health Parameters**: Predicts heart disease based on user input of health parameters like age, sex, cholesterol level, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Heart Disease dataset**, which contains multiple features about patients and whether they have heart disease (target variable).

### Data Features

- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Gender of the patient (1 = Male, 0 = Female)
- `cp`: Chest pain type (0-3)
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Cholesterol level
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = True, 0 = False)
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, or 2)
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Exercise induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0, 1, or 2)
- `ca`: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
- `thal`: Thalassemia (1 = Normal, 2 = Fixed Defect, 3 = Reversible Defect)
- `target`: Whether the patient has heart disease (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
